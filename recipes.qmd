## Baking

Thank you for volunteering to bake for us. We have decided to use set recipes this year to help us better manage stock on the day. Below you will find links to the recipes we would like to use and any extra notes we've added to help. Please do not add or substitute other ingredients to the recipes so that on the day we can be sure exactly what's in each bake and to answer any questions from people with allergies or dietary requirements.

Please **Do not cut cakes or traybakes.** This will help us keep the cakes fresher and allow us to control portion sizes.

## Dropping off bakes

Please ensure bakes are in sealed containers. If you'd like your container back after the event, please label the container with your name/contact details - these details will not be shared with anyone outside of our volunteers.
