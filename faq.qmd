### Why are we fundraising?

We are fundraising to pay for repairs to our Wallingford hut and to support our girls on their trip to Mexico in 2026. 

### Why can't we bake other cakes?

We have decided to use set recipes so that we can be sure of what stock we have and what ingredients have been used. This will help us on the day to better manage our use of stock and to help people with allergies and dietary requirements to enjoy our cakes safely.
