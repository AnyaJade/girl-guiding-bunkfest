Bake for an additional 15-16 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\nCool muffins for 10 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack until ready to eat.\n\nAdapted from https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/double-chocolate-muffins/#tasty-recipes-96196.\n\n\n\nPlease use a shop bought Gluten Free Brownie mix. For example:\n\nTesco Free From Chocolate Brownie Mix\nBetty Crocker gluten free chocolate fudge brownie mix\n\nDo not cut.\nPlease attach the empty packet / box to the container of brownies so we know the ingredients.\n\n\n\nIngredients\nSponge:\n225g (8oz) butter or baking spread at room temperature, plus extra for greasing\n225g (8oz) caster sugar\n275g (10oz) self-raising flour\n2 level tsp baking powder\n4 free-range eggs\n4 tbsp milk\n2 unwaxed lemons, finely grated zest only\n\nGlaze:\n175g (6oz) granulated sugar\n2 lemons, juice only\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nPreheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease the tin with butter and line the base with baking paper.\nMeasure all the ingredients into a large bowl and beat for 2 minutes, or until well blended. Turn the mixture into the prepared tin and level the top.\nBake for 35–40 minutes, until the cake has shrunk a little from the sides of the tin and springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip in the centre of the cake.\nMeanwhile, make the glaze. Mix the sugar with the lemon juice and stir to a runny consistency.\nLeave the cake to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then lift out, with the lining paper still attached, and place on wire rack set over a tray.\nBrush the glaze all over the surface of the warm cake and leave to set. Do not cut.\n\nAdapted from https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/lemon_drizzle_traybake_01890.\n\n\n\nUsing a vegan butter for example:\n\nVitalite\nFlora Plant Butter\nStork\n\nThere is the option to add dried fruit (no nuts) or to leave plain.\n\nIngredients\n200g (7oz) vegan butter (see note above)\n150g (5oz) demerara sugar\n4 Tbsp. golden syrup\n400g (14oz) jumbo oats\nOptional: 100g (3½oz) raisins or sultanas\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nPreheat oven to 190°C (170°C fan) mark 5. Grease and line a 20.5cm (8in) square baking tin with parchment paper.\nMelt the butter in a large pan and add the sugar, syrup, cinnamon and orange zest.

Lightly grease two 20cm (8in) deep loose-bottomed sandwich tins and line the bases with non-stick baking paper.\nMeasure the sponge ingredients into a large bowl or freestanding mixer and beat for about 2 minutes with an electric whisk until beautifully smooth and lighter in colour. The time will vary according to the efficiency of the mixer.\nDivide the mixture between the tins and level the tops. Bake in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until well risen and golden and the cakes are shrinking away from the sides of the tins. The tops of the cakes should spring back when pressed lightly with a finger.\nLeave the cakes to cool in the tins for a few moments, then run a palette knife around the edge of the tins to free the sides. Turn the cakes out, then peel off the paper and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.\nChoose the cake with the best top and sit aside. Put the other cake top downwards on a serving plate. Spread this cake carefully with the jam. Sit the other cake on top.\nSprinkle with sugar. Do not cut.\n\nAdapted from https://www.maryberry.co.uk/recipes/recipe/victoria-sponge-sandwich."
