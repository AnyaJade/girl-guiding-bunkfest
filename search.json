Turn the mixture into the prepared tin and level the top.\nBake for 35–40 minutes, until the cake has shrunk a little from the sides of the tin and springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip in the centre of the cake.\nMeanwhile, make the glaze. Mix the sugar with the lemon juice and stir to a runny consistency.\nLeave the cake to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then lift out, with the lining paper still attached, and place on wire rack set over a tray.\nBrush the glaze all over the surface of the warm cake and leave to set. Do not cut.\n\nAdapted from https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/lemon_drizzle_traybake_01890.\n\n\n\nTo be made using a vegan butter for example:\n\nVitalite\nFlora Plant Butter\nStork\n\nThere is the option to add dried fruit (no nuts) or to leave plain.\n\nIngredients\n200g (7oz) vegan butter (see note above for suggestions)\n150g (5oz) demerara sugar\n4 Tbsp. golden syrup\n400g (14oz) jumbo oats\nOptional: 100g (3½oz) raisins or sultanas\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nPreheat oven to 190°C (170°C fan) mark 5.

Lightly grease two 20cm (8in) deep loose-bottomed sandwich tins and line the bases with non-stick baking paper.\nMeasure the sponge ingredients into a large bowl or freestanding mixer and beat for about 2 minutes with an electric whisk until beautifully smooth and lighter in colour. The time will vary according to the efficiency of the mixer.\nDivide the mixture between the tins and level the tops. Bake in the oven for about 25 minutes, or until well risen and golden and the cakes are shrinking away from the sides of the tins. The tops of the cakes should spring back when pressed lightly with a finger.\nLeave the cakes to cool in the tins for a few moments, then run a palette knife around the edge of the tins to free the sides. Turn the cakes out, then peel off the paper and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.\nChoose the cake with the best top and sit aside. Put the other cake top downwards on a serving plate. Spread this cake carefully with the jam. Sit the other cake on top.\nSprinkle with sugar. Do not cut.\n\nAdapted from https://www.maryberry.co.uk/recipes/recipe/victoria-sponge-sandwich."
