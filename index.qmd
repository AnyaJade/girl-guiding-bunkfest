We are running a Mad Hatter's tearoom at [Bunkfest 2025](https://bunkfest.co.uk/) on Friday 29th to Sunday 31st August. This site contains
information on ways to support us by [volunteering as staff](staffing.qmd) or by
[baking cakes](recipes.qmd). There is also a section for 
[frequently asked questions](faq.qmd), but please [contact us](contact.qmd) if there is 
anything else.

We're looking forward to seeing you there!
